               <h2>RusticOwl: The Owl vs Crow Debate of the EONS</h2>
               <p>
                  To reiterate, crows don't like owls and owls don't like crows. ... Owls will eat crows but generally do not. Owls, despite having sharp hooked talons and meat tearing beaks, have feathers modified to be quiet in flight to aid them in homing in on food, live prey.

               <p>
                  Clever and cunning, raccoons IQ has been found to be greater than a cat and just below a monkey on the mammal IQ scale. Monkeys are generally found to score just below a human, making them the next highest score when considering IQ.

               <h2>The_Coding_Zeta: WALRUS OR BUST</h2>
               <p>
                  The population of walruses was almost eliminated due to commercial hunting, but the population was brought back to a thriving number in the 1980s. The IUCN does not have a category or criteria on the conservation status of the walrus. This is because the animal's population is currently unknown. The organization does say that the population is large, but declining, due to climate change.

               <p>
                  It’s a common myth that crocodiles can run fast on land. They can ‘belly run’ up to 17 kilometers per hour (11 mph) for short distances."

               <p>
                  A single pangolin can eat up to 70 million insects in a year. Pangolins are more closely related to cats, dogs, and bears than to armadillos and anteaters. These animals close their ears and nostrils to keep out insects while eating.

               <p>
                  Baby capybaras are not effective swimmers at first, so they stay on land, hiding under brushy cover. Their smaller stature and inability to swim well make them susceptible to predators like foxes, vultures, feral dogs, and piranhas.
